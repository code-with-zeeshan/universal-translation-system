## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Script 1 (Advanced Research Tool)

```bash
# 1. Prepare your corpus files
mkdir -p data/corpora
# Add your corpus files: en_corpus.txt, es_corpus.txt, etc.

# 2. Configure your requirements
python tools/create_vocabulary_packs.py \
  --languages en,es,fr \
  --pack-name "custom_european" \
  --vocab-size 30000 \
  --optimization "compression"

# 3. Analyze results
cat vocabs/custom_european_v1.0.json | jq '.metadata'
```

**Best for:** Researchers, ML engineers working on novel approaches, specialized domain applications

### For Script 2 (Production Tool)

```bash
# 1. Prepare standard corpus structure
mkdir -p data/processed
# Add corpus files following naming convention: {lang}_corpus.txt

# 2. Create all standard packs
python vocabulary/create_vocabulary_packs_from_data.py

# 3. Or create specific pack
python vocabulary/create_vocabulary_packs_from_data.py \
  --group latin \
  --output vocabs/
```

**Best for:** Production deployments, standard multilingual applications, quick prototypes

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Startup Building Mobile Translation App
**Recommended: Script 2**
```python
# Quick, reliable setup for common languages
creator = VocabularyPackCreator()
creator.create_pack('latin', ['en', 'es', 'fr', 'de', 'it'])
# Result: ~25MB vocabulary pack covering 5 languages
```

### Example 2: Research Lab Analyzing Code-Mixed Text
**Recommended: Script 1**
```python
# Custom analysis for Spanish-English code-switching
config = VocabConfig(
    min_token_frequency=5,
    subword_ratio=0.4  # Higher for mixed text
)
creator = VocabularyPackCreator(corpus_paths, config)
# Detailed frequency analysis for optimization
```

### Example 3: Medical AI Company
**Recommended: Script 1**
```python
# Domain-specific optimization
medical_config = VocabConfig(
    target_size=35000,  # Larger for technical terms
    min_token_frequency=3,  # Include rare medical terms
    compression_level=6  # Balance size vs. speed
)
```

### Example 4: Open Source Translation Project
**Recommended: Script 2**
```python
# Standard, maintainable approach
creator = VocabularyPackCreator()
creator.create_all_packs()  # Creates all language groups
# Easy for contributors to understand and extend
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Script 1 Performance Profile
- **Strength:** Highly optimizable for specific use cases
- **Weakness:** Requires tuning and testing
- **Best Case:** 50% size reduction with maintained quality
- **Typical Case:** 20-30% improvement over standard methods

### Script 2 Performance Profile
- **Strength:** Consistent, predictable performance
- **Weakness:** Less flexibility for extreme optimization
- **Best Case:** Industry-standard performance
- **Typical Case:** Reliable 95%+ coverage with standard size
