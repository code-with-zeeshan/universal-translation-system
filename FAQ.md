# ðŸ“‹ FAQ: Universal Translation System

## ðŸ”¥ **Core Differentiation Questions**

### **Q1: Why not just use M2M-100 or NLLB-200 quantized?**

**A:** Our system is config-driven, modular, and supports dynamic scaling and monitoring. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### **Q2: What makes your vocabulary pack system unique?**

**A:** Packs are managed via a config-driven, orchestrated pipeline, registered with the coordinator, and dynamically loaded by SDKs. See [Vocabulary_Guide.md](Vocabulary_Guide.md).

### **Q3: How do you maintain quality with such a small model?**

**A:** Through smart quantization, adapters, and config-driven training. See [GOAL.md](GOAL.md).

## ðŸ’¡ **Technical Architecture Questions**

### **Q4: Why split encoder and decoder?**

**A:** Enables edge encoding, cloud decoding, and dynamic scaling via the advanced coordinator. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### **Q5: How is privacy preserved if you're using cloud?**

**A:** Only embeddings are sent to the cloud; text never leaves the device. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### **Q6: What about offline translation?**

**A:** Planned via config-driven updates and SDK support. See [future_plan.md](Data_Training_markdown/future_plan.md).

## ðŸš€ **Business/User Questions**

### **Q7: Who is this system designed for?**

**A:** Developers, privacy-conscious users, and organizations needing scalable, monitored translation. See [docs/SDK_INTEGRATION.md](docs/SDK_INTEGRATION.md).

### **Q8: How does the pricing model work?**

**A:** Flexible, with free SDKs and scalable cloud API. See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

### **Q9: What languages are supported?**

**A:** All languages listed in `data/config.yaml` and visible in the coordinator dashboard.

## ðŸ”§ **Developer/Technical Integration Questions**

### **Q10: How hard is it to integrate into existing apps?**

**A:** SDKs are config-driven and easy to integrate. See [docs/SDK_INTEGRATION.md](docs/SDK_INTEGRATION.md).

### **Q11: Can I use my own vocabulary/terminology?**

**A:** Yes, via the config-driven pipeline and custom vocabulary packs. See [Vocabulary_Guide.md](Vocabulary_Guide.md).

### **Q12: How does this compare to Google Translate API costs?**

**A:** Significantly lower, with more privacy and flexibility. See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Future/Roadmap Questions**

### **Q13: What's the roadmap?**

**A:** Dynamic scaling, advanced dashboard, and full offline support. See [future_plan.md](Data_Training_markdown/future_plan.md).

### **Q14: How do you handle model updates?**

**A:** Config-driven, with seamless updates and monitoring. See [docs/CI_CD.md](docs/CI_CD.md).

### **Q15: What makes this defensible against big tech?**

**A:** Modular, scalable, privacy-first, and open for community contributions. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
