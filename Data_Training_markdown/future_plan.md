# Future Roadmap

This document outlines the future roadmap for the Universal Translation System, building on our current capabilities.

## 1. Enhanced Offline Support
- Implement full offline translation capabilities for scenarios with limited connectivity
- Optimize decoder for edge devices to enable complete on-device translation
- Create lightweight language-specific models for common translation pairs

## 2. Advanced Language Support
- Expand beyond current 20 languages to support 50+ languages
- Improve support for low-resource languages
- Add specialized domain vocabulary packs for medical, legal, and technical fields

## 3. Advanced Monitoring & Analytics
- Enhance Prometheus and Grafana dashboards with more detailed metrics
- Implement predictive scaling based on usage patterns
- Add user-specific analytics for enterprise deployments

## 4. SDK Enhancements
- Add voice input/output capabilities to all SDKs
- Implement real-time translation for conversations
- Support document translation with formatting preservation
- Enhance WebAssembly support for web applications

## 5. Performance Optimization
- Further reduce model size while maintaining quality
- Implement more efficient compression algorithms for embeddings
- Optimize for new hardware accelerators (NPUs, specialized AI chips)

## 6. Enterprise Features
- Add multi-tenant support for enterprise deployments
- Implement role-based access control for coordinator dashboard
- Add custom terminology management for organization-specific vocabulary
- Support private vocabulary packs and custom models

## 7. Integration Ecosystem
- Create plugins for popular platforms (CMS, messaging apps, etc.)
- Develop API connectors for major cloud services
- Build integration with content management systems

## 8. Community Growth
- Establish contributor program for language specialists
- Create educational resources for customizing the system
- Build showcase of implementation examples
