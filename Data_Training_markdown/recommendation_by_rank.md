# Recommendation by Rank

This document provides recommendations for improving data quality, training, and deployment, ranked by impact and feasibility.

## 1. Data Quality
- Use config-driven language and pair selection in `data/config.yaml`
- Prioritize high-resource pairs and those with high BLEU/BERT scores (see `tests/test_translation_quality.py`)
- Monitor data pipeline logs and Prometheus metrics for bottlenecks

## 2. Training
- Use the integrated pipeline (`data/practical_data_pipeline.py`) for consistent preprocessing and augmentation
- Adjust batch size and training distribution in `config/training_*.yaml` based on hardware and data availability
- Monitor training progress with logs and Prometheus metrics

## 3. Deployment
- Use the advanced coordinator dashboard for real-time monitoring and load balancing
- Add/remove decoder nodes as needed for scaling (see `tools/register_decoder_node.py` and dashboard)
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for advanced analytics and alerting

## 4. SDK Integration
- Ensure all SDKs are updated with new languages and endpoints
- Use integration tests to validate end-to-end translation quality
