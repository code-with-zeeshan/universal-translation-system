# Redis Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement Redis integration in the Universal Translation System.

## 1. DecoderPool Class Updates

The `DecoderPool` class in `coordinator/advanced_coordinator.py` has been updated to:

- Accept a Redis URL parameter or use `REDIS_URL` from environment
- Connect to Redis via `utils.redis_manager.RedisManager` if available
- Load and save decoder pool configuration to Redis (sync API via RedisManager)
- Fall back to file-based storage if Redis is unavailable
- Provide better logging for troubleshooting
- Periodically mirror Redis data to disk for robust fallback

Key methods added/updated:
- `reload_sync()`: Sync reload that reads from RedisManager if available and mirrors to disk
- `_load_from_redis()`: Asynchronously load configuration using RedisManager; mirrors to disk
- `_save()`: Save to Redis (via RedisManager) and always mirror to disk
- `mirror_redis_to_disk()`: Mirror latest Redis state to `configs/decoder_pool.json` without mutating memory

## 2. Background Tasks

- The coordinator's background task now:
  - Handles requested reloads via watchdog
  - Performs health checks periodically
  - Mirrors Redis state to disk at a configurable interval

Environment variable:
- `COORDINATOR_MIRROR_INTERVAL` (seconds, default 60, minimum 5) controls periodic mirroring
- The effective interval is validated and logged at startup

## 3. Register Decoder Node Tool Updates

The `tools/register_decoder_node.py` tool continues to support:

- Coordinator API registration (preferred)
- Redis-backed registration when API is unavailable
- File-based fallback registration

Additional logging ensures clarity about which path was taken.

## 4. Rate Limiter Updates

The `RateLimiter` class in `utils/rate_limiter.py` supports:

- Redis-backed distributed rate limiting (preferred)
- In-memory fallback with consistent interfaces

## 5. Docker Compose Updates

The `docker-compose.yml` file includes a Redis service and required health checks.

## 6. Requirements Updates

The `requirements.txt` ensures the Redis dependency is available.

## 7. Documentation

- `REDIS_INTEGRATION.md`: Comprehensive guide to the Redis integration
- `IMPROVEMENTS.md`: Notes on coordinator + Redis mirroring improvements
- `ONBOARDING.md` and `Adding_New_languages.md`: Coordinator-Redis notes

## 8. Testing Considerations

- Test with and without Redis available
- Validate mirroring by comparing Redis keys and `configs/decoder_pool.json`
- Test multiple coordinator instances sharing the same Redis

## 9. Future Improvements

- Add Redis Sentinel support for high availability
- Implement Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling
- Add Redis pub/sub for real-time decoder pool updates
- Add integration tests to validate mirroring cadence and correctness
