# System Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Universal Translation System.

## 1. Documentation Improvements

### 1.1 Environment Variables Documentation
- Added monitoring-specific variables to environment-variables.md
- Added training-specific variables to environment-variables.md
- Fixed the link to the troubleshooting guide

### 1.2 Security Documentation
- Created comprehensive security best practices documentation (SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md)
- Added guidance on JWT secret management
- Added network security recommendations
- Added container security best practices

## 2. Docker Configuration Improvements

### 2.1 Docker Compose Health Checks
- Updated health checks to use wget instead of curl
- Added wget to the Dockerfiles to ensure it's available

### 2.2 Docker Compose Environment Variables
- Updated JWT secret default values to use secure random generation
- Added clear instructions in .env.example for generating secure secrets

## 3. Kubernetes Configuration Improvements

### 3.1 Resource Requests
- Added resource requests alongside limits for better scheduling
- Ensured consistent resource allocation

### 3.2 Health Probes
- Added Kubernetes health probes (liveness and readiness)
- Configured appropriate timeouts and failure thresholds

## 4. Code Structure Improvements

### 4.1 Main Entry Point
- Enhanced error handling for subprocess calls
- Added comprehensive logging for command execution
- Implemented proper exit code handling

## 5. Prometheus Configuration Improvements

### 5.1 Comprehensive Prometheus Configuration
- Created a complete Prometheus configuration with proper scrape configs
- Added recording rules for common queries
- Added alerting rules for critical conditions

## 6. Testing Improvements

### 6.1 Configuration Testing
- Added tests for environment variable configuration
- Created validation for configuration files
- Added CI workflow for testing configuration

## 7. Performance Optimization

### 7.1 Decoder Optimization
- Created a script for optimizing the decoder model
- Implemented quantization support
- Added benchmarking capabilities
- Added TorchScript conversion

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

### 8.1 Docker Build Validation
- Enhanced CI workflow for Docker builds
- Added Kubernetes manifest validation
- Added configuration testing workflow

## 9. Performance and Resource Management Improvements

### 9.1 Memory Management System
- Implemented comprehensive memory monitoring for both system and GPU memory
- Added automatic cleanup mechanism based on configurable thresholds
- Integrated model optimization for inference with support for torch.compile
- Created alert system with callback support for extensibility
- Added memory usage tracking to status endpoints

### 9.2 Profiling System
- Implemented comprehensive function and code section profiling
- Added bottleneck detection with configurable thresholds
- Created support for multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, TXT)
- Implemented history tracking for trend analysis
- Added profiling to key methods like model loading and batch processing

### 9.3 Configuration System Enhancement
- Created hierarchical configuration with separate classes for different concerns
- Added support for memory management configuration
- Added support for profiling configuration
- Implemented HTTPS enforcement configuration
- Enhanced configuration loading/saving with YAML support

### 9.4 HTTPS Enforcement
- Implemented configurable HTTPS enforcement middleware
- Added path exclusions for health check and metrics endpoints
- Implemented comprehensive security headers
- Added configuration options for HTTPS port

## 10. Redis Integration and Coordinator Improvements

### 10.1 RedisManager Centralization
- Coordinator switched to using `utils.redis_manager.RedisManager` for all Redis operations (sync usage in async flow)
- Removed direct async Redis client usage in coordinator internals

### 10.2 Periodic Redis-to-Disk Mirroring
- New `DecoderPool.mirror_redis_to_disk()` method mirrors Redis state to `configs/decoder_pool.json` without mutating in-memory state
- Background task periodically mirrors Redis to disk to keep file fallback fresh
- Interval controlled by `COORDINATOR_MIRROR_INTERVAL` (default 60s), validated with 5s minimum and startup logging

### 10.3 Robust Reload and Save Paths
- `_load_from_redis()` loads via RedisManager and mirrors to disk
- `_save()` persists via RedisManager and always writes disk as backup
- Improved logging for all code paths and fallbacks

## Next Steps
